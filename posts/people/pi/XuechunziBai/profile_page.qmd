Bai's Ph.D. work, advised by Drs.[Â Susan Fiske](https://www.fiskelab.org/) and [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/index.php), explores psychological **origins of social stereotypes**; how individual-level exploratory behaviors lead to societal-level stratification. For more information on her current and future research, refer to her [research](https://www.xuechunzibai.com/_files/ugd/508ff5_a9761fde2381468eb0ca22020e841240.pdf) statement or [this](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976211045929) paper. Details about her mentorship can be found in the [teaching](https://www.xuechunzibai.com/_files/ugd/508ff5_a4d8c1f8bbfa46b6b3eb235a3f06a085.pdf) statement.
