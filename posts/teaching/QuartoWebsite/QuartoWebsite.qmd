> **An intuitive understanding** - Domain: store address - Host: store - Content: products - yml: instruction and label - qmd: product - css: Product packaging

# A basic introduction to Quarto website

Follow this step-by-step tutorial blog: [Creating your personal website using Quarto (ucsb-meds.github.io)](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/) you'll know 1. What is Quarto, and why do we use it? 2. Initiate, modify, publish your website in RStudio

Also, here is an straightforward illustration for the logistics of your Quarto folder. You can use it as a reference \[\[Quarto folder logistics.png\]\]

### Complements

**Q**: Failed to configure GitHub using `usethis::use_github()`. \
**A**: Your RStudio is not well-configured Solution: \
 1. Get token - [New Personal Access Token (Classic) (github.com)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) - name: "Quarto token" - access: repo  - expiration:"no expiration" **save** \
2. Configure token in R `usethis::gh_token_help()` `GITHUB_PAT=your_personal_access_token_here` \
3. re-run command `usethis::use_github()`

**Q**: "Failed" to create `.nojekyll` file \
**A**: `.nojekyll` is a hidden file, relax

**Q**: Failed to push my files to Github repo

``` {style="background-color:#E6E6E6;"}
git push
>>> error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400 Bad Request
```

**A**: Due to the large size of the uploaded file, it failed. Try increasing your buffer capacity by using `git config http.postBuffer 524288000`

**Q**: I don't want to preview web pages multiple times through `build-render`, which fills my browser with tons of tabs. \
**A**: Two ways of continuous preview: 1. Recommended: Run the terminal, then switch to the root directory of your website folder, and type `Quarto preview`. You only need to save the file changes in RStudio to proceed with the update. （Sometimes this won't work, so try another one) 2. `build-render` to start a preview, And press the `refresh` (or `F5`) on the browser to update

**Q**: I can't see the changes I expected on the Github website. \
**A**: Remember to render before publishing. Especially when you directly add files from outside RStudio Operation logic: First, render locally to obtain the HTML file. Then push it to the repository and publish it.

**Note**: *A pitfall of file organization*: \
Do not name files/folders as "Global" or something similar This name may conflict with Github, causing loading failure: - Unable to load images - Unable to navigate to pages (404)

**Tips**: *An incredible trick to simplify your CSS tuning*: \
Use `inspection` on the webpage to view the category of the target element, so that you know *where* to modify in CSS. It also supports direct modification of parameters to preview the effect (so that you know *how much* to change).

-   It is always good to gain inspiration from others' excellent works, because there are some outstanding designs that we couldn't even imagine before seeing them. Actually, the inspiration for website design comes from two aspects:
    -   *Websites similar to your goal*: which features to include on your own website.
        -   [Saxelab](https://saxelab.mit.edu/)
        -   [FeldmanHallLab](https://www.feldmanhalllab.com/)

    -   *Websites unrelated to your goal, but fancy*: design techniques, may be useful in future requirements
