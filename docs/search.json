    "section": "",
    "text": "Stereotypes of social groups have a canonical multidimensional structure, reflecting the extent to which groups are considered competent and trustworthy. Traditional explanations for stereotypes – group motives, cognitive biases, minority/majority environments, or real-group differences – do not specify a broadly applicable mechanism that explains why stereotypes vary along multiple dimensions. We show that multidimensional stratification and the associated stereotypes can result from a simple mechanism: When individuals make self-interested decisions based on past experiences in an environment where exploring new options carries an implicit cost, they are more likely to separate groups. We formalize this theory with the contextual multi-armed bandit problem, use the model to generate testable predictions, and evaluate those predictions against human behavior. Our results show that even well-intentioned and attentive individuals living in diverse environments can inadvertently impede diversity and form incorrect beliefs. A further theoretically motivated experiment shows intervening on the cost of exploration can mitigate stereotypes."

    "title": "Globally Inaccurate Stereotypes Can Result From Locally Adaptive Exploration",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Inaccurate stereotypes—perceived differences among groups that do not actually differ—are prevalent and consequential. Past research explains stereotypes as emerging from a range of factors, including motivational biases, cognitive limitations, and information deficits. Considering the minimal forces required to produce inaccurate assumptions about group differences, we found that locally adaptive exploration is sufficient: An initial arbitrary interaction, if rewarding enough, may discourage people from investigating alternatives that would be equal or better. Historical accidents can snowball into globally inaccurate generalizations, and inaccurate stereotypes can emerge in the absence of real group differences. Using multiarmed-bandit models, we found that the mere act of choosing among groups with the goal of maximizing the long-term benefit of interactions is enough to produce inaccurate assessments of different groups. This phenomenon was reproduced in two large online experiments with English-speaking adults (N = 2,404), which demonstrated a minimal process that suffices to produce biased impressions."

    "title": "Measuring Implicit Bias in Explicitly Unbiased Large Language Models",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two new measures of bias: LLM Implicit Bias, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Implicit Bias adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Decision Bias operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). Our prompt-based LLM Implicit Bias measure correlates with existing language model embedding-based bias methods, but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias. These new prompt-based measures draw from psychology’s long history of research into measuring stereotype biases based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks."
