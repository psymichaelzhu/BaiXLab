    "section": "",
    "text": "Stereotypes of social groups have a canonical multidimensional structure, reflecting the extent to which groups are considered competent and trustworthy. Traditional explanations for stereotypes – group motives, cognitive biases, minority/majority environments, or real-group differences – do not specify a broadly applicable mechanism that explains why stereotypes vary along multiple dimensions. We show that multidimensional stratification and the associated stereotypes can result from a simple mechanism: When individuals make self-interested decisions based on past experiences in an environment where exploring new options carries an implicit cost, they are more likely to separate groups. We formalize this theory with the contextual multi-armed bandit problem, use the model to generate testable predictions, and evaluate those predictions against human behavior. Our results show that even well-intentioned and attentive individuals living in diverse environments can inadvertently impede diversity and form incorrect beliefs. A further theoretically motivated experiment shows intervening on the cost of exploration can mitigate stereotypes."

    "text": "Stereotypes of social groups have a canonical multidimensional structure, reflecting the extent to which groups are considered competent and trustworthy. Traditional explanations for stereotypes – group motives, cognitive biases, minority/majority environments, or real-group differences – do not specify a broadly applicable mechanism that explains why stereotypes vary along multiple dimensions. We show that multidimensional stratification and the associated stereotypes can result from a simple mechanism: When individuals make self-interested decisions based on past experiences in an environment where exploring new options carries an implicit cost, they are more likely to separate groups. We formalize this theory with the contextual multi-armed bandit problem, use the model to generate testable predictions, and evaluate those predictions against human behavior. Our results show that even well-intentioned and attentive individuals living in diverse environments can inadvertently impede diversity and form incorrect beliefs. A further theoretically motivated experiment shows intervening on the cost of exploration can mitigate stereotypes."

Her Ph.D. work, advised by Drs. Susan Fiske and Tom Griffiths, explores psychological origins of social stereotypes; how individual-level exploratory behaviors lead to societal-level stratification.

    "text": "Our research studies the origin and evolution of mental representations of human groups. In particular, we take a dynamic perspective by asking two essentially interlinked questions: First, how do individual minds adaptively but selectively construct the social world? Second, how does the constructed social world mold individual minds?\nDr.Bai will be reviewing materials for postdoc researcher, graduate student, and research assistant positions for the 2024-25 cycle, see details in this doc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborators\n\n\nAlexander Todorov\nSusan Fiske\nTom Griffiths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni\n\n\nAlumni1 (Currently at Yale)\nAlumni2 (Currently at MIT)\nAlumni3 (Currently at MIT)"
