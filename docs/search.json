Future work should study how idiosyncratic and biased individual experiences become entrenched, not mitigated, within collective systems. Our approach extracts the minimal conditions under which stereotypes can emerge, but it needs real-world corroboration. Future work can use historical, immigration, or organizational datasets to examine adaptive exploration in everyday choices. Costly exploration should be added to the list of psychological mechanisms that can lead to stereotypes, creating an opportunity for future research that integrates these different mechanisms."

    "title": "Measuring implicit bias in explicitly unbiased large language models",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two new measures of bias: LLM Implicit Bias, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Implicit Bias adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Decision Bias operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). Our prompt-based LLM Implicit Bias measure correlates with existing language model embedding-based bias methods, but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias. These new prompt-based measures draw from psychology’s long history of research into measuring stereotype biases based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nWhile significant progress has been made in reducing stereotype biases in LLMs, there is still much to be learned from the origin of these biases: humans. Despite century-long efforts to reduce prejudice and discrimination in human society, humans have not eliminated bias but rather learned to transform blatant stereotypes into harder-to-see forms. Grounded in the psychological literature, we proposed LLM Implicit Bias to measure implicit biases and found prevalent stereotype biases in a set of value-aligned LLMs across diverse social categories, many of which reflect existing stereotypes that divide human society. These implicit biases are diagnostic of model behaviors in decision tasks as measured by our LLM Decision Bias, demonstrating their importance. Taken together, our approach showcases how psychology can inspire new approaches for assessing LLMs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Inaccurate stereotypes—perceived differences among groups that do not actually differ—are prevalent and consequential. Past research explains stereotypes as emerging from a range of factors, including motivational biases, cognitive limitations, and information deficits. Considering the minimal forces required to produce inaccurate assumptions about group differences, we found that locally adaptive exploration is sufficient: An initial arbitrary interaction, if rewarding enough, may discourage people from investigating alternatives that would be equal or better. Historical accidents can snowball into globally inaccurate generalizations, and inaccurate stereotypes can emerge in the absence of real group differences. Using multiarmed-bandit models, we found that the mere act of choosing among groups with the goal of maximizing the long-term benefit of interactions is enough to produce inaccurate assessments of different groups. This phenomenon was reproduced in two large online experiments with English-speaking adults (N = 2,404), which demonstrated a minimal process that suffices to produce biased impressions.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nModel demonstration\n\n\nVideo\nthompson sampling\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributions of groups\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nDrawing on theoretical analysis, simulations, and empirical data, we propose that inaccurate stereotypes can result from locally adaptive exploration. Rather than rebut prior explanations, we provide a complementary perspective, a process that is general and deep, inde- pendent of group motives, cognitive limits, or informa- tion constraints. Perhaps one origin of stereotypes is much simpler than has been thought; even minimal process assumptions can recreate it. However, this sim- plicity is also troubling: If stereotypes can result from each person pursuing their own self-interest, we may need to work harder to create environments in which problematic stereotypes do not develop."

    "title": "As diversity increases, people paradoxically perceive social groups as more similar",
    "section": "",
    "text": "With globalization and immigration, societal contexts differ in sheer variety of resident social groups. Social diversity challenges individ\u0002uals to think in new ways about new kinds of people and where their groups all stand, relative to each other. However, psychological science does not yet specify how human minds represent social diversity, in homogeneous or heterogenous contexts. Mental maps of the array of society’s groups should differ when individuals in\u0002habit more and less diverse ecologies. Nonetheless, predictions dis\u0002agree on how they should differ. Confirmation bias suggests more diversity means more stereotype dispersion: With increased expo\u0002sure, perceivers’ mental maps might differentiate more among groups, so their stereotypes would spread out (disperse). In contrast, individuation suggests more diversity means less stereotype disper\u0002sion, as perceivers experience within-group variety and between\u0002group overlap. Worldwide, nationwide, individual, and longitudinal datasets (n = 12,011) revealed a diversity paradox: More diversity consistently meant less stereotype dispersion. Both contextual and perceived ethnic diversity correlate with decreased stereotype dis\u0002persion. Countries and US states with higher levels of ethnic diversity (e.g., South Africa and Hawaii, versus South Korea and Vermont), online individuals who perceive more ethnic diversity, and students who moved to more ethnically diverse colleges mentally represent ethnic groups as more similar to each other, on warmth and compe\u0002tence stereotypes. Homogeneity shows more-differentiated stereo\u0002types; ironically, those with the least exposure have the most-distinct stereotypes. Diversity means less-differentiated stereotypes, as in the melting pot metaphor. Diversity and reduced dispersion also correlate positively with subjective wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nGlobalization and immigration expose people to increased di\u0002versity, challenging them to think in new ways about new people. Yet, scientists know little about how changing demography affects human mental representations of social groups, relative to each other. How do mental maps of stereotypes differ, with exposure to diversity? At national, state, and individual levels, more diversity is associated with less stereotype dispersion. Paradoxically, people produce more-differentiated stereotypes in ethnically homoge\u0002neous contexts but more similar, overlapping stereotypes in di\u0002verse contexts. Increased diversity and decreased stereotype dispersion correlate with subjective wellbeing. Perhaps human minds adapt to social diversity, by changing their symbolic maps of the array of social groups, perceiving overlaps, and preparing for positive future intergroup relations. People can adjust to diversity"
